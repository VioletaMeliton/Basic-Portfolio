        <p> My name is Violeta Meliton. I am really excited to be in this course. I currently work at
            a manufacturing company as a Production Planner, but want to change career paths. I have
            been divorced for almost three years and have two beautiful daughters who are 8 and 6
            years old. My daughters are the reason I want to have a succesfull carrer and job. I want
            to be an example and role model for them.
